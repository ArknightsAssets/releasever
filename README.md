In `releasever.json` you can find a mapping of character id to the first version they appeared in.

Notes:
- There is no data for characters before `19-12-28-08-02-55-e463c0` (Few days before Snowsant's release). PR to fix this would be appreciated.
- Release version timestamp does not refer to when the version is released to players. Typically the character is only available several days after the timestamp.
- `char_008_owl` and `char_279_knit3` are not playable characters and will not show up in `character_table.json`
